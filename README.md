This is my first Git Hub repository
Hi my name is Paul O'Donoghue, I am currently a student studying a Diploma of Web Development.  I am 48, so it seems like I am trying to crack into the industry at a late age.  But, I love computers and aside from that I also have a diploma of IT.  Which is handy piece of knowledge to posses.  I live in Perth Western Australia with my wife and [now] three children.  I say now because, our second youngest contracted cancer and before the doctors had a chance of saving her. All hope was lost! That was five years ago, and not only myself, but my family suffered PTSD, Sever depression and an array of illness throughout the grieving process.  I still miss my daughter, who was 4yr 10mnth.  She would be turning 10 on the 31st of March.  But thats me in a nutshell, oh, I almost forgot, I use to be a truck-driver.  Now I study and my wife is the Canteen manager of our local school. Okay. That's it!
